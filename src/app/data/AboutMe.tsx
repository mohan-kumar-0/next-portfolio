About Me

Hi, I'm Mohan — a full-stack software developer based in India.

I specialize in building end-to-end web applications using technologies like:
- JavaScript
- React
- Spring Boot
- Python
- Java
- C++

Outside of coding, I love diving into system design,
exploring emerging tech trends, and continuously refining 
my skills across the stack — from crafting intuitive UIs to designing scalable backend systems.

Always open to collaborating on exciting ideas or just having a chat!
